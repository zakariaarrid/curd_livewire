# Getting Started with Laravel Livewire

Code to accompany [our tutorial on Livewire](https://www.sitepoint.com/laravel-livewire-getting-started/), a full-stack framework for Laravel that allows us to build dynamic interfaces without writing a whole lot of JavaScript. 

In this tutorial we create a live CRUD app, where Livewire handles all the AJAX requests required to update the UI. This includes filtering the results via the search field, sorting via the column header, and a simple pagination (previous and next). Creating and editing users makes use of Bootstrap Modals.
